### Viewing previous orders

To view previous orders click the **View Previous Orders** link and a list of all previous orders with customer info will be displayed for the most recent day.

Administrators will have a date selection dropdown of days orders have been placed to view previous days profit, *non-administrative employees will not have this option*

### Adding employees and administrators

Employees and administrators can be added from the **Admin** screen. If a username appears to not be able to register, try adjusting the username and re-submitting. The form will turn green when this is successful.
